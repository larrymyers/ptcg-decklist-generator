# Pok√©mon TCG Deck List Generator

Hate filling out deck lists by hand before a local tournament? Me too. My penmanship is horrible.

This allows you to export a deck list from [Limitless](https://limitlesstcg.com) or [PTCG Live](https://tcg.pokemon.com/en-us/tcgl/) and have a deck list automatically filled out.

# Setup

Requires the latest Node.js LTS release.

```
npm install
npm start
http://localhost:4321
```

To build a release:

```
./build.sh
```

To run the tests:

```
npm test
```
